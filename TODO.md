# FreeCode Implementation TODOs

## Pending

### Extensibility gaps (audit 2026-07-31)

What a user can extend without editing FreeCode's source. Covered today: MCP servers,
skills (incl. `~/.claude/plugins` scope), permission rules via `.freecode/settings.json`,
and `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md` instructions. Ranked by value per line of work.


- [ ] **3. User-defined subagents** — `SubagentType` (`apps/core/src/agent/types.ts:38-43`)
      is a closed union of five, with descriptions in `SUBAGENT_DEFINITIONS`. No
      `.freecode/agents/*.md` loader. Bind loaded agents to the existing capability
      profiles in `permission/profiles.ts`. Reuse the frontmatter-markdown loader
      already in `commands/loader.ts` (which shipped item 2, user-defined slash
      commands).

- [ ] **4. Rules hierarchy** — `context/instructions.ts` reads `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md` from
      exactly two dirs (global `~/.freecode/`, project root), first match wins.
      Missing: walk-up for monorepos, `@imports` (both deferred in the comment at line 6),
      and glob-scoped rules (the Cursor `.mdc` model — "apply only for `**/*.tsx`").
      Nested-directory rules would also give scoped skills somewhere to live.

- [ ] **5. Multimodal input** — `MessagePart` (`packages/shared/src/types.ts:12-19`) is
      text/code/tool only, and `read` cannot return an image. Blocks screenshots, design
      mocks, and diagram debugging. Touches the shared protocol + every provider adapter.

- [ ] **7. MCP server (expose)** — serve FreeCode's tools *as* an MCP server. The client
      side is done. Already listed as deferred in `CLAUDE.md`.

- [ ] **8. Checkpoints / rewind** — `rollout/` has full event sourcing and `replay.ts`, but
      there's no user-facing way to undo a turn's file changes. Mostly a command + a
      file-state diff on top of machinery we already paid for.


**Suggested order:** 3, then 4. Items 5 and 8 are larger, self-contained
projects. (Item 2, user-defined slash commands, shipped as `commands/loader.ts`.
Item 6, background bash, shipped as `tools/shells/` + `bashoutput`/`killbash`
and the TUI's `/shells` panel.)

### Background shell completion notifications (added 2026-09-08)

**Status:** designed, not built. Follow-up to the background-bash work (ex-item 6).

Today a background shell is **pull-only**: the model learns a command finished
only by calling `bashoutput`, and it has no reason to call it once the turn has
ended. So "run the eval, tell me when it's done" works if the user asks again
30 minutes later, and never volunteers the result. Claude Code does volunteer
it, and the mechanism is worth copying rather than inventing:
`tasks/LocalShellTask` calls `enqueuePendingNotification({ mode:
'task-notification' })` on exit, which pushes a synthetic user message
(`<task-notification><status>completed</status><summary>Background command "X"
completed (exit code 0)</summary>`) onto the message queue; the REPL drains
that queue between turns **including when idle**, so the model is re-invoked
and reports back on its own. `utils/collapseBackgroundBashNotifications.ts`
exists only to squash a burst of those into one line.

What FreeCode already has:

- exit detection with a callback — `ShellRegistry.start({ onExit })`
  (`tools/shells/registry.ts:31`), already fired on natural exit and on
  `kill`/`killAll` (`:190`).
- a follow-up message queue — `queue-store.ts`, `server.ts:476`.
- per-turn reminder injection — `AgentLoop.pendingReminders`.

The two gaps:

- [ ] **Nothing tells the model.** `shell_exit` is a `StreamEvent` consumed by
      the TUI only. `pendingReminders` cannot carry it as-is: `loop.ts:648`
      resets the array at the start of every `run()`, so anything pushed after
      a turn ends is discarded. Needs a cross-turn queue (or an enqueue into
      the existing message queue, which is closer to Claude Code's shape).
- [ ] **The queue never drains while idle.** `server.ts:267` drains it in the
      `finally` of a *running* turn, and `:284` deletes the session from
      `activeLoops` when there is nothing queued. With no turn in flight
      nothing ever looks at the queue again, so an enqueued notification would
      sit there until the user typed. **This is the actual work**: an idle
      watcher that starts a turn when the queue gains an item and
      `!activeLoops.has(sessionId)`.

Also needed once those land: collapse a burst (five shells finishing at once is
one notification, not five turns), and suppress the notification when the model
already drained that shell to completion via `bashoutput` — otherwise the
notification buys a redundant paid turn.

**Why it is not built yet:** gap 2 means the agent starts *billable turns with
no user input*. A misfiring watcher burns tokens while nobody is watching, and
it overlaps the deliberately-Phase-0-only `autonomous/` work, whose whole point
is that unattended execution gets signed off per phase. Ship it default-**off**
behind a setting (`shells.notifyOnExit`, plus the usual
`FREECODE_DISABLE_*` escape hatch), and decide explicitly whether a completion
may interrupt a turn already in progress or must wait for it.

### Subagent permission profiles still never attach (added 2026-09-08)

**Status:** partly mitigated, the real fix is item 3 above.

`createToolOrchestrator()` is called with `{}` at all three production sites
(`effect/layers.ts:63`, `:179`, `agent/loop.ts:429`). `OrchestratorOptions.permissionProfile`
is real and checked (`tools/orchestrator.ts:150`, `:329`), but nothing outside
`permission/` ever constructs a profile, so `PROFILES`, `PermissionChecker`,
`TOOL_PERMISSIONS`, `getProfile`, `createProfile` and `validateProfile` are all
dead — plus there is a duplicate `PermissionProfile` interface in
`tools/types.ts:39`.

Subagents are **not** unsandboxed, which is the part that is easy to overstate:
`executeSubagent` maps `defaultReadOnly` to `agentMode: "explore"`
(`agent/subagent.ts`), and explore hard-denies mutating tools
(`modeEnforcement`), filters them out of the tool list entirely
(`tools/defs-cache.ts:59-71`), and never prompts (`modeAllowsAsk`). So
explorer/reviewer/summarizer/verifier are genuinely confined.

The real gap is that **mode is binary**. There is nothing between explore and
build, so a subagent that is allowed to write at all runs with the exact
authority of its parent: no path scoping, no network restriction, no allowlist.
Two guard rails now stand in for the missing sandbox — `MAX_AGENT_DEPTH`
(`agent/registry/`) bounds the spawn tree, and `agent(readOnly)` defaults true
so the common case (analysis, search, review) is confined to `explore` and
cannot mutate anything. Neither is a substitute for per-agent capabilities: a
`readOnly: false` subagent under a `danger` parent has the whole toolbox and
nothing scopes it to the files it was asked about.

Wiring `permissionProfile` in **as it stands would break subagents
immediately**: the profile axes (`fileRead`/`fileWrite`/`network`/`shell`/
`subprocess`) are a second, coarser permission model bolted beside
`permission/rules.ts` + `mode-policy.ts`, and `isToolAllowed` fails closed on
any tool missing from the hand-maintained `TOOL_PERMISSIONS` map — which today
lacks `ls`, `grep`, `glob`, `webfetch`, `todowrite`, `lsp`, `bashoutput`,
`killbash`, and every MCP tool. So before item 3 binds user-defined agents to
profiles, either complete that map or replace it with a per-subagent tool
allowlist that rides the existing rules evaluation rather than sitting beside
it.

### The compaction eval case is a 20KB JSONL line (added 2026-09-08)

**Status:** known, cosmetic, needs a paid run to fix.

`compaction-survives-multi-file-edit` is 20,339 characters on one line; every
other case in `evals/coding.jsonl` is 743-921. The spec chose JSONL because it
is "diffable, appendable, one case per line", and a 20KB line is not diffable —
any future edit to that case renders as one unreadable changed line.

The six padded fixture modules are what make it big, and they may now be larger
than they need to be: the padding was sized to grow the transcript, before the
calibration runs showed that growth is not what gates compaction (user-turn
count is). They still have to clear the 16,000-token threshold — the base
request measured ~12.5k WITH the padding — so shrinking them means either a
smaller threshold or fewer modules, and either way one more calibration run
(~$0.025) to confirm it still compacts 3/3. Not worth doing on its own; worth
folding into the next change that touches the case.

### `/agents (N)` counts running agents, which is almost always 1 (added 2026-09-08)

**Status:** open design question, not a bug.

`AgentTool` declares `isConcurrencySafe: false`, so `planToolBatches` puts every
`agent` call in its own batch and subagents run strictly one at a time. The
ModeLine chip counts RUNNING agents, so it reads `(1)` whenever anything is
delegated and nothing otherwise — the roster accumulates rows, the chip does
not. Three options, none obviously right:

- leave it (honest about what is running, matches the `/shells` chip);
- count agents spawned this session, so the chip matches the roster's length;
- make `agent` concurrency-safe so they genuinely run in parallel. That is the
  Claude Code behaviour, but the tool is marked `isDestructive` deliberately,
  and parallel subagents mutating one tree is what that flag guards against.

### Settled background shells are retained until dismissed (added 2026-09-08)

**Status:** known, bounded, low priority.

`ShellRegistry` caps *running* shells at `MAX_SHELLS_PER_SESSION` (16) but does
not cap settled ones — a completed shell keeps its record and up to
`SHELL_BUFFER_CHARS` (256k) of output until the user presses `d` in `/shells`
or the session ends. A long session that backgrounds many short commands
therefore creeps: ~0.5 MB per settled shell, worst case. Deliberate for now —
keeping the output is the point, and `d` plus session teardown both free it —
but if it bites, evict the oldest settled shells past a retention count in
`ShellRegistry.start()`. Do NOT evict running ones: nothing else holds a handle
that can kill the process (same reason `remove()` refuses a running shell).

### `@` mention fallback ignores .gitignore

**Status:** Known limitation of the fd-less path (added 2026-09-01)

`apps/tui/src/utils/file-search.ts` stands in for fd when fd isn't installed (the normal
case on Windows — see `at-mention-provider.ts`). fd respects `.gitignore`; the walker only
skips a hardcoded `SKIP_DIRS` list, so ignored-but-not-listed paths (build output under an
unusual name, `.claude/worktrees/`, generated fixtures) still show up in `@` suggestions.
Fix by parsing the nearest `.gitignore` files, or by shipping fd the way
`hooks/builtin/rtk-installer.ts` ships rtk. Neither is worth doing until someone complains.

Related, same Windows-parity batch: `readImageOnWindows()` in `apps/tui/src/utils/clipboard.ts`
goes through `Clipboard.GetImage()`, which reads the DIB clipboard format and therefore
drops alpha — a screenshot is fine, a copied transparent PNG comes back matted. Apps like
Chrome and the Snipping Tool also publish a `PNG` clipboard format; preferring
`GetDataObject().GetData('PNG')` when present would preserve the original bytes.

### Effect/Layer DI (Complex - Skipped for now)

**Status:** Skipped - requires significant architectural change using Effect framework

**Reference:** opencode's `packages/opencode/src/effect/` directory for `makeRuntime<I, S, E>()` pattern

## Docs-audit findings (memory, sessions, knowledge graph — 2026-08-23)

Found while writing `apps/docs/app/internals/{memory,sessions,knowledge-graph}`.
Each is also listed in that page's **Known gaps** section. Sorted by kind: the
second group must NOT be "fixed" — they are deliberate and load-bearing.

### A. Real fixes

- [ ] **`Contradicts` edges are never produced** — the kind, its zero weight, and
      the cascade skip are implemented and tested (`graph-types.ts:17`,
      `cascade.ts:59`), but nothing detects that two memories disagree. Contradiction
      handling is `supersedes:` only, which requires the writer to already know.
- [ ] **VectorStore rewrites everything on every write** — `put()`/`remove()` call
      `persist()`, re-serializing all vectors + both files (`vector-store.ts:181`).
      ~768 KB rewritten per save at 500 memories.
- [ ] **VectorStore lookups are linear scans** — `hasFresh`/`has`/`remove` `find()`
      over the array (`vector-store.ts:129`), and `syncVectors()` calls them per
      entry → O(n²) per full sync. Add an id→index `Map`.
- [ ] **Cluster ids are positional** — adding one memory can renumber every
      cluster (`clusters.ts:139`), so cluster identity doesn't survive a rebuild and
      anything the explorer persists about one is meaningless afterwards.
- [ ] **`nodeDetailForExplorer` is O(nodes + edges) per click** —
      rebuilds a node map and scans all edges per request (`graph/index.ts:394`).
- [ ] **Dangling wikilinks are invisible** — skipped correctly (`builder.ts:78`),
      but a typo'd `[[link]]` never surfaces anywhere. The explorer should list
      unresolved links.
- [ ] **`compact.occurred` under-reports what compaction did** — it records
      `MemoryService`'s ESTIMATED transcript sizes, while the real trim is
      `keepLastNUserTurns` over the session store. Measured on the new
      `compaction-boundary` eval case: the event says 872 → 748 tokens for a
      request that measured 16K. So `freecode trace` and the harness's
      `Trace.compactedTokens` understate compaction by an order of magnitude.
      `ApplyCompactionResult` already carries `messagesBefore`/`messagesAfter`
      and neither is recorded — record those, and the measured count alongside
      the estimate.
- [ ] **Dead export: `renderPromptMemoryContext()`** (`selector.ts:64`) —
      referenced only by `loop.ts` comments explaining why it must not be used.
- [ ] **`getContextLimit(model)` ignores its argument** (`tokens.ts:20`) and
      returns the constant floor. Rename or drop the parameter.
- [ ] **Blocked-compaction retry threshold is hardcoded** — fixed 5,000 tokens
      (`service.ts:34`, flagged `ponytail` in-code); make it a `CompactionConfig`
      field if a hook ever needs tighter control.
- [ ] **`METHODS` declares 24 of 49 implemented IPC methods** — all of `memory.*`,
      `config.*`, `models.*`, and `session.{fork,switch,archive,delete,export,
      import,upload,download,getInterrupted}` exist in `server.ts` but not in
      `packages/shared/src/ipc/protocol.ts`. Frontends calling them get zero
      compile-time checking, which is the entire purpose of that map.
      (`CLAUDE.md` describes it as the source of truth — it isn't yet.)
- [ ] **`METHODS["session.send"]` is wrong** — declares
      `StreamResponse | { queued, id }` as the result; the handler resolves a
      `LoopResult` (`agent/types.ts:309`). Declared params also omit `model` and
      `agentMode`, both read by the handler (`server.ts:376`).
- [ ] **No `-32602` invalid-params validation** — every handler does
      `params as { … }` with no runtime check, so a missing or mistyped field
      becomes `undefined` deep inside and surfaces as a confusing `-32603`.
      A one-line guard per handler (or a shared validator keyed off `METHODS`)
      would move the failure to the boundary where it belongs.
- [ ] **TUI client can only stream one session at a time** — single
      `activeStreamId` + single `onStreamEvent` slot (`apps/tui/src/ipc/client.ts:46`),
      even though `bus/bridge.ts` stamps `sessionId` specifically to allow
      multiplexing. Blocks any multi-session UI over one core process.

        One thing I checked and didn't report as a bug: manual /compact builds its own MemoryService separate from the loop's. That would be a divergence risk,
  except a fresh loop (and service) is constructed per turn at server.ts:199 and reloads state from disk, so they stay consistent.

### B. Deliberate — do NOT "fix"

- **`MEMORY.md` is never injected.** Injecting it makes the cached system prefix
  depend on the store, so every save busts the session's prompt cache. Locked by a
  test in `mem-prompt.test.ts` (guidance block must be byte-identical).
- **`memory` is blocked in plan/review/explore.** Fail-closed was chosen knowingly;
  the cost is that a preference stated while planning isn't captured.
- **`MAX_SAVES_PER_RUN = 3` and the extraction gates.** The cap stands in for a
  consolidation pass that doesn't exist. Raise it only after consolidation ships.
- **Two logs — `messages.jsonl` mutable, `events.jsonl` append-only.** Looks like
  duplication; it is the reason compaction can trim history without destroying the
  record of what happened.
- **Cascade skips `Contradicts`; tag/cluster nodes relay but never score.**
- **Compaction fires on a cost target (120K), not on window fit.** Fit-only left a
  1M-window session re-sending 270K every turn — 48.1M input tokens in one
  7-message session. Raising `FREECODE_COMPACT_TARGET_TOKENS` reverts that.
- **Tool-result pruning freezes anything already sent whole.** It looks wasteful;
  it is what keeps the prompt-cache prefix byte-stable. Do not replace it with a
  sliding window.
- **`MAX_OVERFLOW_COMPACTIONS = 3`, and the retry is not re-wrapped.** A second
  overflow in one turn means compaction isn't converging; looping burns quota.
- **Stream events are bare `{type,…}` objects, not JSON-RPC notifications.** The
  envelope-free shape is intentional; changing it breaks all four clients at once.
  (Standardising on notifications is still worth considering — listed under fixes.)
- **`-32002` is a distinct code, not a generic internal error.** Two frontends
  answering one prompt is a race, not a failure; the loser renders "already
  answered" as state.
- **Web auth gates `/api` and `/events` but not the static SPA.** Gating the page
  would block the page that delivers the token.
- **k-means determinism (`SEED = 42`, id-sorted points).** Non-deterministic
  clustering means the same store retrieving different memories on different days.

### C. Roadmap (needs a spec first, not a fix)

- [ ] **Consolidation / episodic → semantic promotion.** `rollout/` has every past
      turn on disk; nothing mines it. Extraction only ever sees the live transcript,
      so a fact that only becomes clear on the fifth repetition is never learned.
- [ ] **Bi-temporal validity** — valid-time vs transaction-time, so "the host ran
      Apache until March" is expressible instead of only replaceable. Entries carry
      `createdAt`/`updatedAt` (transaction time) only.
- [ ] **Learned procedural memory** — skills and `.freecode/commands/` are real
      procedural memory, but hand-authored. Nothing distills a successful sequence
      into a reusable procedure with preconditions.
- [ ] **ANN index for vectors** — `cosineTopK` scans every vector
      (`vector-store.ts:199`). Exact and correct for hundreds; this is the ceiling.
- [ ] **Tuning values are guesses** — cap 3, interval 8, 200-char minimum, seed
      threshold 0.4, decay 0.7. Chosen to bound cost, not derived from data.

## Docs-audit findings (reference: CLI, settings, env, IPC, hooks — 2026-08-23)

Found while writing `apps/docs/app/reference/{cli,settings,env,ipc-methods,hook-events}`.
Each is also listed in that page's **Known gaps**. IPC items already covered by the
earlier audit are not repeated here.

### Real fixes

- [ ] **`settings.json` has three loaders and three different merge rules.**
      `permissions` concatenates both scopes, `hooks` override by `event + name`,
      `memory` takes the first definition (project → user → default). Nothing states
      the difference and `/getting-started/configuration` claims a single "project
      wins" rule that only holds for hooks. One loader that parses the file once and
      hands each subsystem its section would make one answer true.
- [ ] **`FREECODE_HOME` is read in exactly one place** — the updater's
      `builds/stable/freecode` lookup (`apps/tui/src/entry.ts:101`). Every data path
      (`config.json`, `sessions/`, `projects/`, `rollout/`, `history.jsonl`) builds
      from `os.homedir()` directly, so setting it produces a half-relocated install.
      Honour it through one `freecodeHome()` helper, or rename it.
- [ ] **Six env vars need a process restart and nothing says so** —
      `FREECODE_TOOL_RESULT_BUDGET_CHARS` (`loop.ts:152`) and the five
      `FREECODE_OUTPUT_*` values (`tools/output-store/config.ts`) are module-load
      consts, while the compaction and cache vars are deliberately read per call.
- [ ] **`graph.explore` breaks the memory naming convention** and hard-codes
      `process.cwd()` while every neighbouring `memory.*` method takes `projectPath`.
- [ ] **MCP servers are user-scope only.** `getConfigDir()` is hard-wired to
      `~/.freecode` (`cli/utils/config.ts`), so a repository cannot ship the MCP
      servers its contributors need the way it can ship rules and hooks.
- [ ] **`freecode session` exposes 2 of 12 session operations.** `fork`, `switch`,
      `archive`, `export`, `import`, `upload`, `download` are IPC-only, so scripting
      session management means speaking JSON-RPC by hand.
- [ ] **No way to print effective configuration.** Diagnosing "why is it compacting
      so early" means reading source. A `freecode config env` dumping
      name / default / effective / source would pay for itself.

### Deliberate — do NOT "fix"

- **Hook exit codes fail closed, timeouts fail open.** A hook that answered is
  trusted; a hook that never answered is skipped. Both directions are intentional.
- **`permissions` merges rather than overrides across scopes.** Deny is checked
  first, so a project can neutralize a user-scope allow by adding a deny — it just
  cannot delete it. That is the safe direction for a file that travels with a repo.
- **Bash prefix rules refuse compound commands.** `Bash(npm:*)` never matches
  `npm test && rm -rf /`; the word-boundary and shell-separator checks are the
  security property, not an oversight.
- **MCP argument patterns never match.** `mcp__linear(x)` fails closed by design;
  server-level rules are the supported granularity in v1.
- **Hook payloads are env vars, not stdin JSON.** A three-line bash script is a
  complete hook implementation in any language, with nothing to parse.

## Docs-audit findings (agent loop — 2026-08-23)

Found while writing `apps/docs/app/internals/agent-loop`. Each is also listed in
that page's **Known gaps**.

### Real fixes

- [ ] **A loop-health `warn` still reaches nobody by default.** The signal is now trustworthy,
      but every `warn` goes to `logger.debug` (`loop.ts:737`) — invisible at the
      default log level and never shown to the model, so nothing acts on a stuck
      pattern until it doubles into a `stop`. Phase 1 of
      `specs/2026-08-26-trajectory-redirection.md`.
- [ ] **The spend circuit breaker is off by default** (`loop.ts:812`,
      `compaction/tokens.ts:105`). `FREECODE_MAX_TURN_TOKENS` is unset unless the
      user sets it, so nothing caps actual spend. `freecode run` now has
      `--max-turns` for a turn cap, but nothing caps tokens by default, and
      loop-health only *warns* on the stuck patterns most likely to burn quota
      (stagnation never stops at all). Consider a default ceiling for headless
      runs.

### Deliberate — do NOT "fix"

- **Dynamic context is a user message at position 0, not a system block.** The
  static system block stays a stable cacheable prefix only because the tree, git
  HEAD and clock live below it, with a fixed id and `timestamp: 0`.
- **The project snapshot and the clock are frozen per session.** A fresher tree
  costs the entire conversation prefix; an hour-rounded clock exists so position 0
  doesn't rewrite itself on the hour boundary.
- **A frozen tool result is never shrunk.** Saving ~250 tokens by replacing a
  result already in the cached prefix costs a partial invalidation worth far more.
- **Oscillation scores inverse edits, not repeated edits.** Editing one file many
  times is what real work on a large file looks like.
- **Loop-health braking is two-tier (warn at 1×, stop at 2×).** Long legitimate
  tasks routinely breach the first threshold.
- **Memory extraction is fired without `await`.** The user's result must not wait
  on it, and a memory failure must never surface as a task failure.
- **`compactAndRetry` does not re-wrap its retry.** A second overflow in one turn
  means compaction isn't converging; looping burns quota.
- **A quota-exhausted 429 is never retried.** Waiting cannot help, and each retry
  re-sends the whole conversation for a guaranteed rejection.
- **Provider errors are stringified before they reach logs or the bus.** The SDK
  error carries the entire request on `requestBodyValues`.

## Docs-audit findings (provider layer — 2026-08-23)

Found while writing `apps/docs/app/internals/providers`. Each is also listed in
that page's **Known gaps**.

### Real fixes

- [ ] **`getProvider()` builds a fresh SDK client per call and reads config from
      disk each time.** `registry.ts:24` calls `def.create("")` on every lookup;
      each adapter's factory calls `getApiKey()`, which does a synchronous
      `readFileSync` + `JSON.parse` of `~/.freecode/config.json`. That is a
      blocking disk read at least once per turn (`callProviderOnce`) plus once per
      compaction (`compactOptions`). Memoize per provider id, invalidating when
      config changes.
- [ ] **`summarizeCache`'s hit ratio is both wrong and unused.**
      `read / (read + inputTokens)` (`cache-awareness.ts:71`) treats `inputTokens`
      as the fresh portion, but `NormalizedUsage.inputTokens` is inclusive of
      cache reads and writes — so reads are double-counted in the denominator.
      Nothing outside `cache-awareness.test.ts:38` reads `hitRatio` (the loop
      destructures only `readTokens`/`writeTokens`), and the test asserts the old
      non-inclusive semantics. Either fix to
      `read / (read + nonCachedInputTokens + write)` and use it, or delete it.
- [ ] **A total cache failure is invisible to the miss detector.**
      `emitCacheWarm` returns before `checkCacheHealth` when reads and writes are
      both zero (`loop.ts:1910`), and `checkCacheUsage`'s `!reportsCache` branch
      would bail anyway (`cache-miss.ts:82`) — so `expected_read_missing` is
      reachable only when a write happened. "Caching stopped entirely" is the case
      most worth alarming on.
- [ ] **Only `anthropic` is treated as a caching provider for the cold warning.**
      `CACHING_PROVIDERS` (`cache-awareness.ts:24`) is a one-element set, but
      `minimax` and `zai` use the same Anthropic endpoint shape and carry the same
      `cacheControl` markers, so their users never see the cold-cache warning.
- [ ] **A changing tool set busts the prompt cache with nothing in the
      journal.** `invalidateToolDefs()` (`tools/defs-cache.ts:49`) fires on
      `tools.changed` / `mcp.tools.changed`; the tools array sits inside the
      cached prefix, so the next request necessarily misses. No
      `recordInvalidation` call, so the detector reports an unexplained bust —
      the false positive the journal exists to prevent.
- [ ] **`ProviderRegistryTag` has no consumer.** Defined at
      `effect/context.ts:60` and wired into both live and test layers
      (`effect/layers.ts:68`, `:182`), but nothing resolves it — the loop calls
      `getProvider()` directly, so the seam that would let a test swap providers
      is inert.
- [ ] **`ProviderDefinition.create(apiKey)` ignores its argument.** All six
      adapters take `_apiKey` and call `getApiKey()` themselves; `getProvider`
      passes `""`. Drop the parameter or actually thread the key through it.
- [ ] **`ExecuteResult.thinking` is dead for every provider.** All six set
      `thinking: undefined` in `execute()`; reasoning reaches the loop only as
      `thinking_delta` on the streaming path, so a non-streaming turn loses
      extended thinking silently. Related: there is no thinking-budget or
      reasoning-effort field anywhere in `ExecuteOptions`.
- [ ] **`ProviderInfo.maxOutputTokens`'s doc comment is stale** (`types.ts:10`).
      It says compaction subtracts it; compaction subtracts
      `resolveMaxOutputTokens()` (models.dev ∧ `OUTPUT_TOKEN_CAP`). The field is
      only a fallback for callers that omit `maxTokens`, and it is 4096 for four
      of the six providers.
- [ ] **`session/normalize/` is unreachable dead code.** The v4 spec describes a
      `ProviderResponseNormalizer` layer with per-provider modules; nothing
      imports it. Real normalization is `streaming.ts` + `mapUsage`. It also holds
      a second `[TOOL_CALLS]` parser duplicating `loop.ts:1959`.
- [ ] **`browser/` has zero importers.** `CLAUDE.md` calls the Playwright path
      "legacy / not wired into the primary path"; it is actually unreachable — no
      file outside the directory imports it, and `chatgpt` is not registered.
      Decide: delete it, or wire it behind a flag and say so.

### Deliberate — do NOT "fix"

- **`PROVIDER_MAX_RETRIES = 0`.** The SDK's own retries multiply with
  `RecoveryManager`'s (3 × 5 = up to 15 full-conversation round trips per turn)
  and it treats an unpayable quota 429 as retryable.
- **Cache markers are set for every provider flavour at once.** The SDK routes
  `providerOptions` by key and ignores the rest, so a model reached through a
  gateway caches as well as a direct one, for free.
- **`ttl` is omitted at 5m rather than sent explicitly.** 5m is the server-side
  default, so omitting it keeps request bytes identical to the pre-knob build —
  the default path cannot regress.
- **The read anchor is the message *before* the newest assistant message, not
  `.slice(-2)`.** `convertToCoreMessages` expands one turn into two messages, so
  the two-back rule lands on two messages that are both new (measured: reads
  pinned at ~7K while input grew to 81K).
- **The last tool carries a cache breakpoint.** Anthropic caches up to and
  including a marked block, so one marker caches the whole tools array; the
  name-sorted tool list is what keeps "last" stable.
- **Malformed tool arguments fail the turn instead of being cast.** The AI SDK
  emits the raw JSON string as `input`; storing it poisons the session
  permanently, because it is re-sent every turn and rejected before reaching the
  model.
- **Timeouts sit at the fetch layer, never around `ProviderChunk`s.**
  `normalizeAiSdkStream` drops `tool-input-delta`, so a large tool call looks
  like a dead stream from above it.
- **`mapUsage` returns `undefined` rather than `0` for unknown counts**, so "no
  usage data" stays distinguishable from a real zero.
- **`modelSupportsImages` fails closed on an unknown model.** An image part sent
  to a text-only model is a hard 400.

## Docs-audit findings (tool system — 2026-08-23)

Found while writing `apps/docs/app/internals/tools`. Each is also listed in that
page's **Known gaps**.

### Real fixes

- [ ] **Four `Tool` metadata fields have zero readers.**
      `behavior.maxResultSizeChars` (set by every tool and by MCP; truncation
      actually uses the global 30K `adaptiveTruncate` budget),
      `behavior.interruptBehavior`, `permissions.operations`, and
      `permissions.requiresApproval` — `bash.ts:290` sets the last to `true` and
      nothing consults it. Either wire them or delete them; right now they read as
      a working permission model that isn't.
- [ ] **`getPath` and `isSearchOrReadCommand` are implemented widely and read
      nowhere.** `getPath` is shadowed by `extractTarget` + `PATH_TOOLS`
      (`permission/rules.ts`), which is what `CLAUDE.md`'s registration checklist
      tells contributors to update — two independent answers to "which path does
      this tool touch", one of them live. `isSearchOrReadCommand` has no consumer
      at all.
- [ ] **`checkPermissions` has no implementers.** The orchestrator calls it when
      present (`orchestrator.ts:107`); no tool defines it.
- [ ] **Permission profiles are unreachable.** `createToolOrchestrator()` is
      called with no arguments at all three production sites (`loop.ts:331`,
      `effect/layers.ts:63`, `:179`), so `permissionProfile` is always `undefined`
      and the `isToolAllowed` branch (`orchestrator.ts:145`, `:286`) never runs.
      `CLAUDE.md` says profiles are "used for subagents" — they are used nowhere.
      Either pass a profile when spawning a subagent or drop `profiles.ts`.
- [ ] **`executeTool` in `factory.ts:88` is dead code**, exported and re-exported
      from `tools/index.ts` but called by nothing; it also implements a different
      result contract from the orchestrator's.
- [ ] **`tool_complete` streams the full untruncated output over IPC.** The
      event carries `result.stdout` (`loop.ts:2280`), correct for rendering but
      uncapped — a 10 MB `bash` result crosses the boundary in one message.
      Consider a display cap with a "show more" fetch, mirroring the `output`
      tool.
- [ ] **`read`'s image path pays before the visibility check.** The tool
      base64-encodes any supported image up to 10 MB and returns it as
      `metadata.image`; whether the model can see images is only decided later in
      the loop (`loop.ts:1525`). A text-only model pays the full read and gets a
      "not sent" notice. Push `modelSupportsImages` into the tool, or pass the
      capability through `ToolContext`.

### Deliberate — do NOT "fix"

- **Coercion is narrow: only an unambiguous numeric literal or exactly
  `"true"`/`"false"`.** `Number()`/truthiness turns `""` into `0` and `"false"`
  into `true`, hiding a malformed call instead of letting the validator surface
  it.
- **Coercion lives at the orchestrator boundary, not in each `execute()`.** The
  declared schema `type` is already the single source of truth, and MCP schemas
  can't be patched per tool.
- **Truncation keeps a head *and* a tail.** Build errors, stack traces and
  summaries live at the end; head-only threw away exactly what was needed.
- **Both truncation cuts snap to line boundaries.** A raw character index lands
  mid-token and the model reads a half-identifier as whole.
- **An `OutputStore` miss returns a message, never an error.** Degrading to
  "re-run the tool" is always recoverable.
- **`edit`/`write` record read-state but are excluded from dedup.** They record
  content the model has never been shown; deduping against it would claim "you
  already have this" while the transcript holds the pre-edit text.
- **Read dedup has a kill switch (`FREECODE_READ_DEDUP=0`).** It is the only
  token-efficiency measure that changes what the model *sees*.
- **An unannotated MCP tool is treated as mutating.** An absent `readOnlyHint`
  says nothing about the tool; guessing "harmless" is how `create_issue` gets
  re-run.
- **Tool defs are sorted by name.** `buildToolsParam` marks the last tool with a
  cache breakpoint, so a stable order is what keeps the tools block cacheable.
- **A `bash` timeout resolves as a failure, not a slow success**, with partial
  output attached — otherwise the loop concludes the command worked.
- **Tools return data, never markup.** Four frontends render the same
  `StreamEvent`s their own way.

## Docs-audit findings (getting started — 2026-08-23)

Found while writing `apps/docs/app/getting-started` (installation, quickstart,
providers, configuration). Each is also listed in that page's **Known gaps**.
Items already tracked elsewhere (`providers.list` returning models.dev's whole
catalogue, the `gemini`/`google` id mismatch, hooks not loading under
`freecode run`, MCP being user-scope only, root-only instruction files) are cited
on the pages but not repeated here.

### Real fixes

- [ ] **Nothing reports which source an API key came from.** The environment
      now overrides the stored key (fixed 2026-09-05), but when both are set
      nothing surfaces which one a request used — a wrong-key 401 still means
      checking both by hand.
- [ ] **`freecode uninstall` ignores the variables the installer honours.** The
      handler hard-codes `~/.freecode` plus four Unix bin paths
      (`cli/commands/uninstall.ts:44`), while `install.sh` supports
      `FREECODE_HOME` and `FREECODE_INSTALL_DIR` and `install.ps1` installs the
      launcher to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\freecode\bin`. On Windows the command reports
      success while leaving the binary on PATH.
- [ ] **Nothing removes the PATH lines the installer appended.** `install.sh`
      writes an `export PATH=…` block into `~/.zshenv`, `~/.bashrc`,
      `~/.profile`, fish's `config.fish`, and any existing `~/.zshrc` /
      `~/.zprofile` / `~/.bash_profile`; uninstalling leaves every one of them
      pointing at a directory that no longer exists.

## Docs-audit findings (context engine — 2026-08-23)

Found while writing `apps/docs/app/internals/context`. Each is also listed in
that page's **Known gaps**.

### Real fixes

- [ ] **`collector.ts` + `context/types.ts` + `context/strategies/` are
      unreachable.** `collectContext()` resolves a strategy from a registry that
      only `createDefaultStrategies()` fills, and that function has no callers — so
      the lookup would fail even if something invoked it. Nothing does:
      `AgentLoop.collectContext` (`loop.ts:2295`) is a private method calling
      `getFrozenSessionContext`. Delete the trio, or wire it and drop `tree-cache`'s
      parallel implementation.
- [ ] **`FileTreeStrategy` implements the design the project explicitly
      rejected** — depth-3 walk reading the **full contents of every file** into
      `files` (`strategies/file-tree.ts:90`), i.e. the "collect files then send
      them" pre-pass the single-agentic-loop architecture exists to avoid. Dead,
      but 126 lines of dead code that reads like the intended design. It also
      builds keys with `path.relative(process.cwd(), …)` instead of the project
      path.
- [ ] **`ProjectContext` is declared twice with different fields** —
      `context/types.ts:5` (dead: `{ projectPath, name, tree, files, metadata }`)
      and `context/tree-cache.ts:14` (live: `{ name, projectPath, tree, gitHead }`).
- [ ] **`invalidateSymbolCache` has no callers** (`repo-map/index.ts:196`). The
      whole-project symbol cache relies on git HEAD + a 5-minute TTL, so
      uncommitted edits inside that window return stale `workspaceSymbol` results.
      The tree-watcher already detects the relevant changes and could call it.
- [ ] **`compileDynamicContext`'s `memoryContext` and `ignorePatterns` are
      permanently dead parameters** (`compiler.ts:185`). Both are always passed
      empty by the only caller. `memoryContext` is load-bearing in reverse — the
      comment explaining why it must never be used is the real documentation — so
      keep the comment, drop the parameter.
- [ ] **The prompt's "file tree" is a single non-recursive `readdirSync` of the
      project root** (`tree-cache.ts:29`). That is a defensible floor, but the word
      "tree" in `CLAUDE.md`, in the compiler's own output header, and in the docs
      oversells it. Rename it, or make the depth a knob.

### Deliberate — do NOT "fix"

- **The project snapshot is one level deep.** The model has `ls`/`glob`/`grep`; a
  recursive monorepo listing would cost thousands of tokens *every turn* to say
  what one tool call can answer.
- **The snapshot and clock are frozen per session.** A fresher tree rewrites
  position 0 and invalidates the entire conversation prefix.
- **Dynamic context is `messages[0]`, not a system block.** The static system
  block stays cacheable only because everything that moves lives below it.
- **`memoryContext` is never rendered into position 0.** It rendered
  `recentMessages`, which grow every turn and are already in the history verbatim.
- **Skills are advertised as name + description only, sorted.** Full bodies load
  on demand via the `skill` tool; the sort keeps identical skill sets producing
  identical bytes.
- **Nothing from `repo-map/` is injected into the prompt.** The pull model means
  symbols cost tokens only when the model asks for them.
- **`getFileSymbols` parses fresh rather than reading the project cache.**
  Single-file results must never be stale.
- **The tree-watcher runs `persistent: false`.** A watcher that keeps the process
  alive hangs every short-lived CLI invocation that ran one turn.
- **The system-prompt loader tries disk before the embedded copy.** Dev picks up
  `system.md` edits without a rebuild; the compiled binary has no disk copy to
  find.

## Eval quarantine hygiene (2026-09-20)

From releasing `todowrite-for-multistep` and `review-mode-readonly` from
`evals/quarantine.txt` (10/10 recent trials each; gate opened on the confirm run).

- [ ] **`--quarantine-report` has no scoring epoch and no recency window.** It
      averages a case's pass rate over the whole of `eval_runs.jsonl`, so on
      2026-09-20 it proposed quarantining three cases that were 7–9/10 recently
      and did NOT propose releasing two that were 10/10 since 09-14 (72–73%
      all-time). Same defect the 08-29 note in `quarantine.txt` records. A
      "last N trials" window, or a per-case epoch stamp when expectations change,
      would make the proposals trustworthy.
- [ ] **Infra trials are not flagged on the outcome scorer.** `TrialResult.infra`
      (2026-09-20) excludes provider errors / stalls / hangs from `majority()`
      on the trajectory suite; `scorers/outcome.ts` only fails on `verify`, so a
      `coding` case whose model call died still counts as an agent failure.
- [ ] Three cases remain quarantined and are all deterministic M3 gaps, not
      flakes: `frustrated-user-wants-one-line` (0/10), `ask-when-the-answer-is-
      off-repo` (1/10), `greeting-uses-no-tools` (3/10, one 25-turn session on
      `hi`). The first two share a cause (M3 answers from memory instead of
      reaching for a tool). A fix is a prompt change measured by `eval ab`.

## Spec findings (eval harness — 2026-08-23)

From writing `docs/specs/2026-08-23-eval-harness.md`. Details in that
spec's §12; these are the parts that are actionable independently of it.

### Real fixes

- [ ] **There is no cost accounting in USD anywhere.** `usage/tracker.ts` records
      tokens and `usage.get` serves them, but a price table exists in exactly one
      file — `providers/minimax.ts`. A shared `providers/pricing.ts` keyed by
      `provider/model` would give `freecode trace`, `usage.get`, and the eval
      harness's efficiency scorer a real number. Without it, "this change made
      every turn 18% more expensive" is undetectable.
- [ ] **OTLP export has no session-level root span** (`rollout/otlp.ts`). Model
      spans are emitted per call, so a multi-turn session renders in Langfuse as N
      unrelated LLM calls. An `invoke_agent` root span plus
      `gen_ai.conversation.id = sessionId` makes it one tree. Cheap — both are
      attribute additions in a file that already builds spans by hand.
- [ ] **Two specs promise a verifier that does not exist.**
      `2026-08-10-autonomous-runs-design.md` says the "verifier/evaluator decides
      completion when configured gates" are set, and
      `2026-08-08-continual-harness-design.md` lets the agent rewrite its own
      harness with no way to measure whether the rewrite helped. Both are blocked
      on the eval spec's Phase 1, and both should say so.

### Docs findings (writing `/internals/eval` — 2026-08-23)

- [ ] **`evalsDir()` is CWD-relative** (`eval/dataset.ts:19`,
      `path.resolve("evals")`), so `freecode eval` fails with "no such suite"
      anywhere but the repo root unless `FREECODE_EVALS_DIR` is set. The shipped
      cases also reference FreeCode's own source paths, so the suite is
      repo-specific and nothing in `--help` says so.

### Docs findings (eval Phase 2 — sandbox + outcome scorer, 2026-08-27)

- [ ] **`bash` escapes the sandbox.** `eval/sandbox.ts` scopes the *file* tools
      and the runner's permission answers to the tmpdir, but a coding case needs
      `bash` and `bash` reaches the whole filesystem (spec §6.3 says so
      explicitly). Cases are trusted fixtures, so this is a limit rather than a
      live hole — but it is why `danger` mode still has no eval coverage, and
      why an untrusted case would need a container (spec §13).
- [ ] **Coding cases are synthetic and small.** Six dependency-free `.mjs`
      fixtures, three-to-four turns each. They catch a harness change that
      breaks editing outright; they will not catch one that degrades work on a
      real codebase. That is the Tier 2 sandbox, blocked on `node_modules`
      (spec §6.2).
- [ ] **`referencedFiles()` in `eval/dataset.ts` is a token scan.** It only
      catches script paths ending `.mjs`/`.cjs`/`.js`/`.json`, so a `verify`
      that reaches a fixture file some other way (a shell redirect, a path built
      inside `node -e`) is not validated at load and will fail at score time,
      reading as an agent failure. Deliberately narrow — broadening it to
      "anything path-shaped" rejects `node --test` — but the gap is real.
- [ ] **`immutable` is checked only against files the case seeded.** A case
      cannot assert "the agent created no new files", so an agent that leaves
      scratch files behind still passes. Nothing depends on this yet.

### Findings (eval Phase 4 — `eval add`, 2026-08-27)

- [ ] **The thread store's turn table is dead code.** `createTurn` is
      implemented in `store/json-store.ts`, `store/sqlite-store.ts` and
      `ThreadStore.addTurn` (`store/thread-store.ts:164`), and **nothing in the
      repo calls any of them**. Verified against a real installation:
      `~/.freecode/state/store.json` holds 118 threads and 0 turns. So
      `StoredTurn`, `StoredToolCall` and `getTurnItemsView` are a persistence
      layer with no writer. Either wire it up or delete it — but it should not
      keep sitting there looking like a source of truth. It already misled the
      eval spec (§5.1's table, corrected in §8.1).
- [ ] **`eval add` cannot harvest a coding case.** A recorded session has no
      `files` fixture, so `--suite coding` is refused. Harvesting a *sandboxed*
      case would mean reconstructing the fixture from the tool calls that
      created it — possible in principle, not attempted.
- [ ] **`expectMaxTurns` is harvested as the observed count exactly**, so a
      drafted case fails on a run one turn longer. A note says so, but a human
      who skims it commits a case that is red by construction. Consider
      emitting `observed + 1`, or a `--slack N` flag.

### Findings (eval Phase 5 — LLMOps close-out, 2026-08-27)

- [ ] **Daily usage has no USD.** `providers/pricing.ts` now exists and feeds
      `freecode trace`, `freecode eval` and the OTLP export, but
      `usage/tracker.ts` still records tokens only — `recordDailyUsage` never
      receives the provider/model that spent them, so the `/usage` heatmap
      cannot be priced without threading that through.
- [ ] **The built-in price table has no refresh path.** Six models, stamped
      `PRICES_AS_OF = "2026-05"`. Nothing warns when it goes stale, and a stale
      table is only safe because the contract is *comparison, not billing* —
      which holds only while everyone remembers it.
- [ ] **`attrs()` in `rollout/otlp.ts` rounds numerics to integers**, with an
      explicit `FRACTIONAL` exception set. Adding a future rate-valued
      attribute outside that set silently reports 0.5 as 1 — this already
      happened once with the suite pass rate, caught only because a test was
      re-read rather than trusted.
- [ ] **§12 item 2 (live OTLP export on turn end) is not built, on purpose.**
      It reverses `2026-08-10-agent-observability.md` §7 and puts a network
      call in the path of a normal run. Wants an explicit decision.

### Findings (eval Phase 3 — the judge, 2026-08-27)

- [ ] **The judged thresholds are uncalibrated.** `JUDGE_MEAN_FLOOR = 3.5` and
      `JUDGE_CASE_FLOOR = 2` come from the spec, which itself says to set them
      "from the first real run, not from this document". No real run has
      happened — no second provider key is configured here. Until one does, a
      judged `--gate` verdict is a guess with an exit code.
- [ ] **No judged run has ever executed.** Everything is unit-tested through the
      `complete` seam, and the unconfigured + same-model paths are verified
      live, but no rubric has been graded by a real judge model. The rubric
      wording in `evals/rubrics/answer-quality.md` is therefore untested against
      an actual grader.
- [ ] **The same-model check cannot see through a gateway route.** It compares
      normalised ids and refuses on same-provider-with-no-model, which catches
      the obvious cases. An OpenRouter path or a vanity alias serving the same
      weights will pass. Mitigation is `SuiteReport.judge` disclosure; there is
      no detection fix, because nothing in a response says what served it.
- [ ] **Judged cases cannot be harvested.** `eval add` emits trajectory cases;
      a rubric is a human judgement about what "good" means for that prompt.

### Findings (eval gate hardening, 2026-08-27)

Closes the four items above that stood between "the harness runs" and "the
harness can block a release". Remaining:

- [ ] **`evalsDir()` is still CWD-relative.** `pnpm eval` covers a checkout and
      the CI workflow sets nothing, but an *installed* binary run from anywhere
      but a repo root still needs `FREECODE_EVALS_DIR`.
- [ ] **No shipped case pins `model`**, though spec §11 says every one should.
      The hazard — comparing across models — is now caught by `baselineFor`
      refusing a cross-model baseline, so this is belt-and-braces rather than an
      open hole.
- [ ] **The CI workflow has never run.** It needs `secrets.*_API_KEY` and
      `vars.FREECODE_EVAL_MODEL` set on the repo, and is `workflow_dispatch`
      only by choice — every case is a real paid agent turn, so billing should
      scale with releases, not pushes. Uncomment `schedule:` to go nightly.

### Docs findings (rewriting `/internals/eval` — 2026-08-31)

- [ ] **`stuck-loop` has 8 cases and none of them can block a release.** All of
      them live in `redirect.jsonl` / `redirect-build.jsonl`, which are A/B
      material and deliberately not part of `eval:gate`. So the registry counts
      the category as covered while the gate has never asserted anything about
      repetition. Either promote one to `trajectory.jsonl` or record why the gate
      does not cover it — `CATEGORIES_WITHOUT_CASES` cannot see the difference,
      because it folds every suite together.

### Deliberate — do NOT "fix"

- **Unit tests stay `*.test.ts` under `src/`.** The 98 existing tests are unit
  tests and must not migrate into `evals/`. A file under `evals/` runs a real
  agent turn; anything that doesn't belongs next to the code it tests. Conflating
  the two is exactly what dilutes the eval signal in the prior art.
- **OTLP export stays off the hot path.** Live streaming is deferred in
  `2026-08-10-agent-observability.md` §7 for a stated reason; shipping from the
  durable log costs only immediacy.

## Spec findings (memory consolidation — prior-art review 2026-08-23)

From reviewing `codex`, `jcode`, `mem0`, and `agentmemory` against
`docs/specs/2026-08-23-memory-consolidation.md` (amended same day,
D12–D14). These are actionable independently of that spec's phases.

### Roadmap (needs its own spec, not a fix)

- **Progressive disclosure instead of a byte cap.** codex's always-loaded
  artifact is a navigational index (`memory_summary.md`) with bodies fetched on
  demand through a read-only memory-fs MCP server (`codex-rs/memories/mcp/`), so
  a long memory is never truncated, only not-yet-read. Strictly better than the
  spec's D2 byte cap, but it is a read-path redesign touching the MCP surface
  and prompt caching.
- **Backfill the rollout archive.** ~390 session directories under
  `~/.freecode/rollout/sessions/` have never been mined; extraction only ever
  reads the live transcript, and the spec's end-of-session flush (D4) does not
  go back for them. codex's answer is a bounded, leased, parallel Phase 1 at
  startup.
- **An LLM retrieval judge, deferred not rejected.** The spec declines waku's
  gate on cost, which is right for waku's shape but not for jcode's: a listwise
  rerank on the existing one-turn-behind prefetch adds no loop latency, and
  jcode's "cadence carry" (re-surface the last judged set without re-running)
  bounds the call rate. jcode treats the *absence* of the judge as a measured
  degradation (`memory_judge_metrics.rs`). Revisit once D14 reports a baseline.

### Deliberate — do NOT "fix"

- **No bare `delete` verb for the consolidator.** A memory can only be removed
  as the `supersedes:` list of a merge. mem0 is evidence for this, not against:
  its v2 manager offers ADD/UPDATE/DELETE/NONE (`configs/prompts.py:176`) and
  its v3 extraction prompt is ADD-only with `linked_memory_ids`.
- **No SQLite job queue for consolidation.** codex needs leases and ownership
  tokens because Phase 1 runs ×8 in parallel across many rollouts. We
  consolidate one project, serially, at most daily. Take the outcome taxonomy
  (`succeeded` / `succeeded_no_output` / `failed`) and the retry backoff; leave
  the queue.
- **Semantic memories do not decay with age.** jcode decays confidence for
  everything; we decay episodes only. Demoting "user prefers tables" for being
  old is how a system forgets a standing instruction. Use is recorded for all
  types, but only episodes' scores are multiplied.


## Memory consolidation — shipped 2026-08-23

Spec `specs/2026-08-23-memory-consolidation.md`, plan
`plans/2026-08-23-memory-consolidation.md`, results
`apps/core/src/memory/bench/README.md`. Six phases, 725 tests passing.

Three findings worth keeping, because each contradicts something the spec said:

- **The free abstention gate does not exist.** Top cosine for on-topic queries
  (0.674–0.932) overlaps irrelevant ones (0.588–0.719); a within-query z-score
  overlaps too. Bi-encoder similarity between short texts has a high,
  corpus-dependent floor. Abstention needs a reader (D15). `bench/probe.ts`
  reproduces the table — run it before proposing any new local floor.
- **BM25 + RRF trades ordering for coverage.** recall@5 and precision@5 up, MRR
  and nDCG down. Right for a block the model reads whole; wrong if retrieval is
  ever used somewhere that only reads the first result.
- **A log-scaled use boost cannot overcome exponential decay.** `1 + 0.1·ln(u+1)`
  tops out near 1.5× against a 4× decay span. Use raises the decay floor instead.

### Found by the smoke test (2026-08-23, real MiniMax turns)

It also found two bugs every unit test passed through — a citation tag that
streamed to the user, and citations parsed and then dropped by an `unref`'d
debounce on a short-lived process. Both are fixed; the fixes are in
`CitationStreamFilter` and `UsageStore`'s synchronous exit flush. One
limitation is still open:

- [ ] **Headless runs never complete background memory work.** `freecode run`
      exits before fire-and-forget extraction or consolidation lands. Fine for
      the daemon (the TUI stays alive), but it means scripted runs never
      consolidate. Consider awaiting them on the headless path with a budget.

### Still open

- [ ] **Wire up LongMemEval-S** (`bench/longmemeval.ts`). The committed corpus
      was written by the same people who wrote the retriever; it catches
      regressions and proves nothing about absolute quality. LongMemEval-S uses
      `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`, the embedder we already run, so agentmemory's published
      numbers are a directly comparable baseline.
- [ ] **Measure the judge with a real model.** Every judge figure so far is from
      `--judge=oracle`, a perfect reader, and is therefore a ceiling.
- [ ] **Watch the judge degradation rate.** It fails closed, so a provider
      outage silently turns memory off. `isDegradation()` marks the cases; if
      they fire often, revisit the direction.
- [ ] **Backfill the rollout archive.** Hundreds of historical session
      directories have never been mined; the end-of-session flush only covers
      live sessions.
- [ ] **`Contradicts` edges are still never produced.** Consolidation emits
      `Supersedes` (the writer-knows case) only.
- [ ] **VectorStore id→index `Map`.** O(n²) full sync matters more now that
      consolidation does pairwise-cosine candidate selection.

## Findings (gemini-web provider — 2026-08-29)

Found while writing `docs/specs/2026-08-29-gemini-web-provider.md`.
Ranked by value. Full context in §8 of that spec.

### Real fixes

- [ ] **E1–E5 are not eval cases.** Every measurement behind the provider's
      design (no tools, mention inlining across turns) was run by hand, so
      nothing detects a regression that re-introduces tools here or breaks
      cross-turn `@mention` collection. The `evals/` sandbox landed 2026-08-27
      and could hold at least E2 (tools vs inlining) and E5 (turn-1 file still
      present on turn 2).
- [ ] **A stale model id degrades silently.** `resolveGeminiWebModel` falls back
      to the default rather than erroring (deliberate — see D8), but the user is
      then served a different model than the one they picked with no signal.
      Wants a one-line notice on fallback, not a throw.
- [ ] **No per-provider "usage not measurable" affordance.** `gemini-web`
      reports no usage on purpose (the endpoint returns no token counts, and
      `chars / 4` would reach the daily tracker as though measured). The
      consequence is a blank meter that reads as "zero spend" rather than
      "unmeasured".

### Housekeeping

- [ ] **`readWebCredential`'s `providers` fallback** is a compatibility shim for
      configs written before the `web` block existed, with no removal plan.
      Dropping it would surface as Pro quietly serving Flash, not as an error,
      so it needs a migration rather than a deletion.
- [ ] **`ProviderCredentials.model` is declared and read by nothing** —
      pre-existing dead field, noticed while designing the `web` block.

### Deliberate — do NOT "fix"

- **`supportsTools: false`.** Measured, not unfinished: the session emitted a
  tool call ~56% of the time and fabricated on the rest. Shrinking the prompt
  55× and cutting 16 tools to 1 did not move it; removing the *need* for a tool
  call did. See spec §4 E1/E2 before touching this.
- **`allowsAuxiliaryCalls` fails open** (`!== false`, not `=== true`). A wrong
  `false` would switch memory off for every provider — far worse than one extra
  request against a quota.
- **The pinned build label rots by design.** It is a fallback; the live scrape
  is the source of truth, and a 4xx force-refreshes it.
- **Every request is a fresh chat** (empty ids in payload slot 2). Using the
  server-side thread would put conversation state somewhere `session/` cannot
  inspect, resume, fork or export.

## Findings (OpenHands comparison — 2026-09-01)

Found while reading the `OpenHands/OpenHands` Agent Canvas frontend (`ca4024e3a`)
for what makes its long-running sessions survivable.

### Long-session fidelity

- [ ] **Compaction summarizes the original task away.** `selectForCompaction`
      preserves only the tail — last `preserveRecentTurns: 2` user turns capped
      at `maxPreserveRecentTokens: 8_000` (`compaction/types.ts:62-63`) — and
      takes `messages.slice(0, firstPreservedIndex)` for the summary
      (`compaction/selector.ts:54`). No head carve-out, so the founding
      instruction is compacted first and, on the next compaction, the summary of
      it is re-summarized. Lossy compounding on the oldest content, which is a
      plausible mechanism for long-session drift off the brief. OpenHands'
      `CondensationEvent.summary_offset` implies a head-preserving condenser
      (inference — their SDK is a separate repo, not readable locally).

- [ ] **`compact.occurred` records magnitude, not content.**
      `rollout/types.ts:125` carries `beforeTokens`/`afterTokens` only. When a
      long session forgets something, "which events left the view" is the first
      question `freecode trace` should answer. OpenHands' `CondensationEvent`
      carries `forgotten_event_ids`. The ids are known at the call site and
      contain no message bodies, so this does not threaten the leak-free OTLP
      constraint.

- [ ] **`rollout/history.ts` has no range query.** `loadSessionEvents` (whole
      file), `getEventsByType`, `getEventCount` — no cursor, no timestamp
      window. Prerequisite for backing SSE replay with the durable log rather
      than the in-memory buffer, which also needs a `RolloutEvent →
      StreamEvent` projection (necessarily lossy: the log stores no message
      bodies, by design).

### Unattended mode (blocks `autonomous/` Phase 1)

- [ ] **No configuration in which a stuck loop stops itself.**
      `effect/loop-health.ts` declares `LoopAction { continue | warn | stop }`
      and returns `warn` from all four detectors (`:38`, `:44`, `:53`, `:62`);
      `stop` is never produced. The only hard stop is `maxIterations`, which is
      `?? Infinity` outside headless (`agent/loop.ts:403`). Correct for attended
      use — see `specs/2026-08-26-trajectory-redirection.md` §1 for why eager
      `stop` was the wrong answer — but an unattended run needs a finite ceiling
      and a `stuck` terminal state distinct from `error`, so a report can say
      "stopped making progress" rather than "crashed". Do **not** copy Canvas's
      own `use-agent-state.ts:31`, which maps `STUCK → ERROR` and loses exactly
      that distinction.

- [ ] **Permission prompts cannot park.** In-band and synchronous, so an
      unattended run that hits one fails rather than waiting. OpenHands models
      this as a durable `waiting_for_confirmation` conversation status plus a
      REST endpoint to answer it later.

### Reconnect hygiene (wanted once replay is rollout-backed)

- [ ] **Replay dedupe must also suppress non-idempotent side effects**, not just
      duplicate rendering. OpenHands issue #1656 was replayed events re-firing
      error banners and cache invalidations
      (`conversation-websocket-context.tsx:553`). FreeCode inherits this hazard
      the moment replay can return events the client already processed.

- [ ] **SSE client needs capped-exponential backoff and a handshake watchdog.**
      Theirs is 1s → 2s → 4s capped at 30s with an abort for sockets stuck in
      `CONNECTING` (`use-websocket.ts:19`, `:61`). The TUI's
      `[250, 1_000, 3_000]`-then-give-up budget (`apps/tui/src/ipc/client.ts:87`)
      is right for a local child process but wrong for a network client.

### Deliberate — do NOT "fix"

- **`session.compact`'s synchronous result is better than theirs.**
  `protocol.ts:244` returns `{compacted, tokensBefore, tokensAfter, reason}`
  directly. OpenHands' `/condense` acks only that work started, forcing a
  150-line frontend hook (`use-await-context-compaction.ts`) with a 2.5s settle
  window and 90s timeout to reconstruct the same numbers. Keep ours.
- **Do not adopt ACP or the multi-backend registry.** Canvas's product is being
  a universal frontend for other people's agents; FreeCode's frontends and
  backend ship together.

## Spec-writing findings (harness cost efficiency — 2026-09-04)

Found while writing `specs/2026-09-04-harness-cost-efficiency.md`.

### Deliberate — do NOT "fix"

- **Eval efficiency stays warn-only** (`scorers/efficiency.ts`). Cost moves when
  the suite changes as readily as when the agent changes; A/B (`eval ab`) is the
  instrument for harness experiments, never the gate.

### Found writing the docs page (2026-09-04)

- [ ] **Output compression only covers `bash`** — no other tool sets
      `metadata.outputKind`, so MCP tools (which can be just as log-noisy) always
      take the blind head+tail path. Extend classification once the D2 A/B proves
      the approach. Recorded in `/internals/cost-efficiency` Known gaps.

## Docs findings (Anthropic subscription login — 2026-09-05)

Found while writing `/getting-started/anthropic-subscription`, the page that
publishes the OAuth ToS stance (`beforeStable.md` P0 #5). Recorded in that
page's Known gaps.

- [ ] **Tool names are forwarded unmapped on the OAuth path.** jcode renames
      tools to the ones Claude Code ships; freecode does not. Spec §9 Q1 — a
      tool-use-*quality* question, not an access or billing one, and it waits on
      a real turn.
- [ ] **No multi-account support.** One Anthropic login per machine
      (`auth.json` is keyed by provider, not by account). Deliberate YAGNI in the
      spec's §2 non-goals; listed here so the docs claim has a home.
- [ ] **`anthropic` is the only provider with an OAuth mode.** `freecode auth
      login` rejects any other provider by name. Fine today — no other catalogue
      entry has a subscription surface freecode can reach.

## Findings (ephemeral-tail cache fix — 2026-09-06)

RC8 in the token-efficiency spec: memory/todo/reminder session system blocks
rewrote the cached prefix every inner-loop turn; moved to
`ExecuteOptions.ephemeralTail` (final user message, appended after the cache
anchors). Detector gained a one-sample deferral for provider blips
(cache-observability spec §D2.1). What remains open:

- [ ] **A full provider-side eviction still alarms as a rewrite.** D2.1 acquits
      a miss whose next read recovers to the pre-miss boundary; a miss where the
      read never recovers (upstream evicted everything) is indistinguishable
      from a real rewrite by usage numbers alone and produces the same warning.
      `FREECODE_DEBUG_CACHE=1` segment hashes are the manual tiebreak.
- [ ] **The UserPromptSubmit hook no longer sees memory/todo/reminder text.**
      The hook rewrites the joined *system* prompt, and those blocks are message
      content now. No known hook depended on them; if one surfaces, the hook
      contract needs a decision (expose the tail read-only, or accept the loss).
- [ ] **`FREECODE_EPHEMERAL_TAIL=0` should eventually be deleted.** It existed
      so `eval ab` could price the two placements; the ledger entry
      (`2026-09-05-redirect-1`) is decided "kept", so the old placement is now
      dead code behind an env flag. Delete the flag, its `VARIABLE_ENV_KEYS`
      row, and the `!tailEnabled` branches in `loop.ts` together.
- [ ] **Watch: do tail-placed todo nudges lengthen tedious runs?** In the A/B,
      `count-something-tedious` ran 22 candidate turns vs 11 baseline (one
      spiral-by-design case, 3 trials — could be variance). If long-run turn
      counts creep after this change, the nudge's salience as the final user
      message is the first suspect.

## Eval-harness finding (memory-system review — 2026-09-06)

- [ ] **Eval turns inject the developer's live memory store, so trajectory runs
      are environment-dependent.** `eval/runner.ts` sets `projectPath:
      process.cwd()` and the loop's `prepareMemories` runs against
      `~/.freecode/projects/<repo>/memory` — a store that grows with every real
      session on the machine. Measured 2026-09-06: the recorded 23/24 baseline
      was unreproducible on the same commit (`main` re-run scored 23/24 but
      flipped `no-tool-for-live-infra-data`, closing the gate; a fix branch with
      byte-identical injection behavior scored 22 then 21). Off-topic prompts
      like the live-infra case get a full 8-memory block (vector cosine floor,
      see `memory/bench/README.md`), and that block differs per machine and per
      week. Fix shape: the runner should isolate memory for unsandboxed cases
      (point the store at an empty temp dir, or a committed fixture store) so a
      case's verdict depends on the code, not on what the developer did
      yesterday. Until then, cross-day gate deltas on trajectory are partly
      memory-store drift.
