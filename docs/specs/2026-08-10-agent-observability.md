# Agent Observability — model-call tracing, stall detection, OTLP export

**Status:** implemented (§3–§6); §7 deferred
**Revised:** 2026-08-11 (v0.23.1) — §4 and §5 corrected after both
false-positived; see the notes in each.
**Date:** 2026-08-10
**Supersedes:** nothing. Extends `rollout/` (event sourcing) rather than replacing it.

---

## 1. Motivation

Session `792889da` ran for 34 minutes, executed 27 tool calls totalling **under
one second** of work, and produced 10,178 output tokens across the whole day.
The remaining ~31 minutes went somewhere the system could not name.

The rollout log had twelve event types covering tools, hooks, skills,
subagents, compaction and parse errors — and none for the provider round trip.
The slowest and most failure-prone step in the loop was the one step that left
no trace. Concretely, three failures compounded:

1. **No duration bound.** Providers received an `abortSignal` and
   `PROVIDER_MAX_RETRIES = 0`, but nothing bounded how long a request could
   take. A provider that accepted the connection and went silent parked the
   loop indefinitely.
2. **No event.** A hang produced no log line at all. In the log it was
   indistinguishable from a turn that simply ended.
3. **No signal to loop-health.** `effect/loop-health.ts` watches for repeated
   tool calls and stagnant turns — patterns that occur *between* model calls. A
   call that never returns generates nothing for it to evaluate.

The user-visible symptom was misleading: the TUI showed the last thing that
emitted an event, so a hung provider call rendered as "stuck on `todowrite`".

## 2. Goals / non-goals

**Goals.** Attribute every second of a session to model, tool, or idle. Make an
unterminated request self-evident in the log. Bound provider silence. Let the
same data reach an external trace UI when one is wanted.

**Non-goals.** Prompt/completion *content* capture (the log records sizes and
token counts, not message bodies — see §6). A hosted service dependency.
Replacing `usage.json` for cost accounting.

## 3. Model call events

Four additions to `RolloutEvent` (`rollout/types.ts`), written by
`RolloutRecorder` around the provider call in `AgentLoop.callProviderOnce`:

| Event               | Written                | Carries                                                         |
| ------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `model.request`     | **before** the call    | provider, model, messageCount, toolCount, promptChars, streamed  |
| `model.first_token` | on the first chunk     | ttft_ms                                                          |
| `model.response`    | on success             | duration_ms, ttft_ms, token counts, tool call names, text sizes  |
| `model.error`       | on failure             | duration_ms, kind (`stall`/`abort`/`provider`), message          |

**The load-bearing decision is that `model.request` is written before the
call.** A request with no matching terminator *is* the hang — the diagnosis is
an absence, and an absence is only detectable if the opening line was recorded
first. Everything in §5 follows from that asymmetry.

`RecordOptions.fields` was added to `recorder.ts` as an escape hatch: model
events carry a dozen fields that mean nothing to any other event type, and
threading each through the existing whitelist would double its length to
describe a shape one caller uses.

`promptChars` is a character count, not a token estimate. It exists to make
runaway context growth visible turn-over-turn, and a cheap comparable number
beats an expensive precise one — `JSON.stringify` over a 100KB prompt every
turn is not worth it.

## 4. Request timeouts — and where liveness must be measured

`providers/fetch-timeout.ts`, wired as the `fetch` option on every provider
factory (`anthropic`, `openai`, `gemini`, `minimax`, `deepseek`, `zai`).

**The first implementation of this measured the wrong layer and had to be
replaced (v0.23.1).** It bounded silence between `ProviderChunk`s — downstream
of `normalizeAiSdkStream`, which forwards 5 part types and drops the rest. The
AI SDK streams a tool call's *arguments* as `tool-input-delta` parts and emits
`tool-call` only once they are complete, so a model writing a large file
produced a continuous stream at the wire and total silence at the measurement
point. The guard aborted healthy requests mid-write. `start-step`, thinking
boundaries and SSE keep-alives were invisible for the same reason.

The lesson generalises: **liveness must be measured where the bytes are, not
where the semantics are.** Any filter between the socket and the timer will
eventually hide a legitimate signal.

| Bound                          | Default | Env                              |
| ------------------------------ | ------- | -------------------------------- |
| Response headers               | 300s    | `FREECODE_HEADER_TIMEOUT_MS`     |
| Silence on a live SSE stream   | 180s    | `FREECODE_SSE_STALL_TIMEOUT_MS`  |

`0` disables either. The header bound is cleared the instant headers arrive, so
it never constrains generation time; the SSE bound counts *any* byte, including
content-free keep-alives. Non-SSE responses pass through untouched. This is the
structure opencode arrived at (`provider/provider.ts`: `timeoutController` +
`wrapSSE`), with one difference: opencode leaves its chunk timeout off by
default and defaults the header timeout for OpenAI only.

`anySignal` rather than `AbortSignal.any`: the latter landed in Node 20 and the
package declares `node >=18`.

Retries remain owned by `RecoveryManager`, which treats a timeout as transient;
see §8.

## 5. Trace assembly and CLI

`rollout/trace.ts` (pure fold, no IO) pairs requests with their terminators.
Pairing prefers matching `turnId` but falls back to the oldest open span,
because turn numbering restarts at `turn-0` on resume and a mismatch must not
orphan a real response into a phantom hang.

An open span is `in_flight` until it has been open longer than
`HANG_THRESHOLD_MS` (300s, matching the header timeout), then `hung`. **The
first version had no such distinction** and labelled every open request `hung`,
so under `--follow` a request one second old rendered as `HUNG` and then
"recovered" when the response arrived. That is not a diagnosis, it is a race
against the redraw — and a warning that fires on healthy runs trains the reader
to ignore it.

`rollout/trace-render.ts` renders a waterfall plus a where-the-time-went
breakdown (model / tools / other). When a log contains no model events at all
it says so explicitly rather than reporting "no hangs" — silence there means
nothing was recorded, not that nothing went wrong.

### 5.1 Refused calls (`function.denied`)

A tool call stopped by a hook, a mode, a rule, or the user **used to leave no
event at all**: `loop.ts` returns before `recordFunctionCall`, so there was no
`function.call`/`function.output` pair for the fold to pair, and a model
burning six turns retrying a command the mode forbids folded into a trace that
said it had done nothing. That is the exact shape loop-health exists to catch,
and it was the one shape the log could not express.

`function.denied` carries `{ tool, args, source, reason }`, where `source` is
`hook | mode | rule | permission-hook | user`. Every refusal in `loop.ts` goes
through one `denyToolCall()` exit so a future deny site cannot forget to record
one.

It folds into **`Trace.deniedSpans`, deliberately not into `toolSpans`**. Seven
consumers read `toolSpans` and every one of them means "tools that ran" — the
trajectory scorer, the judge's tool list, `harvest`'s drafted `expectTool`,
`countRepeatedCalls`, `tool_ms`, evidence, OTLP. A `denied` flag on the
existing array would keep each correct only while each remembered to filter,
and a forgotten filter reads as a mutation that never happened. Additive is the
shape where the unsafe default is impossible.

Consequences worth stating: `forbidTools` in an eval still cannot see a refused
call, and **that is correct** — it scores mutations that landed, so on a
read-only-mode case it stays silent while enforcement works and fires only if
enforcement breaks. It therefore asserts nothing about the model on its own and
must be paired with an `expectTool`. In the evidence packet a denial is
`denied`, never `failed`: a failed call did work and it went wrong, so the fix
is different arguments; a denied call did nothing and the arguments were never
the problem.

```
freecode trace                 # most recent session
freecode trace <id> --follow   # live, 1s redraw — watch a hang happen
freecode trace <id> --slow 30000
freecode trace --list
freecode trace <id> --json
```

## 6. OTLP export

`rollout/otlp.ts`, wired as `freecode trace <id> --otlp [url]`, falling back to
`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` / `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS`. Works with
Langfuse, Phoenix, Jaeger, Tempo, or any OTLP/HTTP collector. Attributes follow
the OpenTelemetry GenAI semantic conventions (`gen_ai.system`,
`gen_ai.request.model`, `gen_ai.usage.*`), which is what makes the spans render
as LLM calls rather than anonymous blobs.

Two constraints:

- **Exported from the log, not the hot path.** An exporter inside the agent
  loop is one more thing that can block, buffer, or throw inside the request
  we are trying to make faster. The log is already durable; shipping from it is
  strictly safer and costs only immediacy.
- **No SDK dependency.** OTLP/HTTP accepts plain JSON, so the exporter is a
  `fetch` and a shape. Span IDs are content-derived so re-export is idempotent.

Because export reads the rollout log, and the log records sizes rather than
message bodies, **no prompt or completion text leaves the machine.** That is a
property of what §3 chose to record, and should be treated as load-bearing if
content capture is ever added.

## 7. Deferred

- **Live OTLP streaming** during a run. The batch path covers post-mortem;
  `--follow` covers live locally.
- **TUI panel.** `/trace` rendering the same waterfall in-app.
- **Prompt/completion capture** behind an explicit opt-in, with the
  secret-filtering that `memory/graph/secret-filter.ts` already implements.
- **Feeding stalls to `loop-health`** so the loop can adapt (e.g. suggest a
  provider switch) rather than only retrying.

## 8. Known follow-up

`RecoveryManager` retries a stall like any transient error. With a 120s
first-chunk budget that is ~6 minutes before a dead endpoint gives up. Whether
a stall should be retried fewer times than a 429 is a policy question left
open here rather than decided silently.
