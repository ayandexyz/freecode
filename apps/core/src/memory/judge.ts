// =============================================================================
// Retrieval judge (spec D15) — decides which surfaced memories are actually
// relevant to the request, or that none of them are.
//
// Why this exists at all: D1 assumed a local scorer could answer "is anything
// here relevant" for free. The benchmark refuted it. On the committed corpus,
// top cosine for on-topic queries spans 0.674–0.932 and for irrelevant queries
// 0.588–0.719 — overlapping, so no absolute threshold separates them. A
// within-query z-score overlaps too ("write a haiku about the sea" outscores
// 13 of 22 real queries). Bi-encoder similarity between short texts has a high,
// corpus-dependent floor; that is a property of the model, not a tuning bug.
//
// So abstention needs a reader. It is made affordable by *where* it runs, not
// by being small: on the existing one-turn-behind prefetch, so the loop never
// waits on it, and behind a cadence carry, so it fires on a topic change rather
// than every turn (jcode's `CadenceCarry`).
