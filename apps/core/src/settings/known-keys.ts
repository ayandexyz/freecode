// The known shape of `.freecode/settings.json`.
//
// Five modules read this file independently — permissions, hooks, memory,
// redirect and signals — and each ignores everything it does not recognise. That is the
// right behaviour per reader, but the sum of it was that an unknown key was
// indistinguishable from a broken feature: `"permission"` for `"permissions"`
// silently disabled every rule in a security-relevant, hand-edited file, with
// nothing on stderr.
//
// This module is the one place that knows the whole shape, so it can say
// "unknown key" — and, when the key is a near miss, which key was meant.
//
// It is a NAME check, not a schema validator. Values stay each reader's
// business: they already validate and default their own, and duplicating
// those rules here would create a second, slowly diverging contract. The JSON
// Schema shipped at `schemas/settings.schema.json` covers types for editors,
// and `known-keys.test.ts` pins the two together.
