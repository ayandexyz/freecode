// Session reminders — nudge the model to maintain a todo list during long work.
// Todo state remains context, not a completion gate: a user may legitimately
// ask for a plan and stop there, with every planned item still pending.
//
// Thresholds follow Claude Code (TODO_REMINDER_CONFIG: 10 turns since the
// last write, 10 between reminders). Until 2026-09-20 they were 3 and 5, the
// most aggressive nudge of any harness we compare against (opencode, codex
// and pi have none), and the rollout fold over 2,553 sessions showed what
// that did: a turn with no list yet wrote one 1.8% of the time unprompted and
// 36.7% of the time on a nudged turn — 97 of the 216 first lists (45%) were
// made on the exact turn the harness asked. With a list the nudge doubled
// the rewrite rate (24.8% → 45.6%) although the list is already re-rendered
// into every prompt. `FREECODE_TODO_NUDGE=legacy` restores 3/5 and the old
// text for `eval ab`; read per call so a variant can flip it per side.
