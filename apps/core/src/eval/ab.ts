//
// `compare.ts` diffs two FINISHED reports, so everything that drifted between
// the two run dates — a rolled snapshot behind a stable alias, a provider-side
// routing change, a different cache state — is confounded into the delta and
// reported as ours. This runs both sides now, interleaved, so the only
// difference left is the one under test.
//
// NOT a gate. Writes nothing to `eval_runs.jsonl`, has no baseline, and always
// exits 0. Results are noisy model-backed signals reported as paired deltas.

 *   FREECODE_DISABLE_MEMORY_JUDGE      `loadMemorySettings`, every call
 *   FREECODE_DISABLE_MEMORY_CONSOLIDATION `shouldConsolidate`, every call
 *   FREECODE_BASH_COMPRESS             `maybeCompressOutput`, every tool call
 *   FREECODE_READ_LINE_NUMBERS         read's `execute`, every call
 *   FREECODE_EPHEMERAL_TAIL            `executeTurn`, every iteration
 *   FREECODE_TODO_NUDGE                `shouldNudgeTodo`/`todoNudgeReminder`,

 *   FREECODE_SYSTEM_FILE               `loadSystemPromptFor`, every turn (the
 *   FREECODE_APPEND_SYSTEM_FILE        compiler rebuilds the system prompt per
 *                                      request; only the shipped .md is cached)
 *   FREECODE_AUTO_POKE                 `loadSignalSettings`, once per AgentLoop
 *   FREECODE_CONFIDENCE_GATE           instance — and the runner builds a
 *   FREECODE_HILLCLIMB_GATE            fresh loop per trial
 *
 * A startup-read var (a provider key, a config path, a fetch timeout baked into
 * the client at `createTimeoutFetch`) would be swapped into `process.env` and
 * then read by nobody. Both sides would run identically and the report would
 * say `unchanged-pass` — a confident verdict on an experiment that never
 * happened, which is the exact failure this command exists to avoid. An
 * allowlist fails loudly instead; extend it only after checking the read site.
