# FreeCode Remote (Android)

Native Android client for [FreeCode](https://github.com/ayan-de/freecode)'s
remote feature (see
`../../docs/specs/2026-08-04-android-remote-client.md`).

This is a thin Compose shell that:

1. **Pairs** with the desktop daemon via QR scan or manual host/port/token
   entry.
2. **Stores credentials** in `EncryptedSharedPreferences` (Jetpack Security).
3. **Hosts the web-app** (`apps/web-app`) inside a `WebView` so all rendering
   and protocol logic stays in the SPA the desktop TUI / VS Code / Web
   frontends already use.
4. **Runs a foreground service** while the agent is `working` or `blocked`
   on an approval, so the screen-off case doesn't lose the answer window.

The spec's `ConnectionScreen` is folded into `ChatScreen`'s connectivity
banner — it shows on a WebView load error or when `NetworkObserver`
reports no network, and carries the re-pair action. That keeps the user
inside the WebView's history instead of bouncing them to a dead end.

It is **not** part of the pnpm workspace — it builds independently via Gradle.
The only tie to the monorepo is the path the WebView loads (`http://host:port/`)
and this README.

## Setup, build and debugging

Full contributor runbook — Tailscale login, MagicDNS, pairing, `adb` recipes,
and the failure modes hit during device bring-up — lives in
[`docs/mobile-remote-setup.md`](../../docs/mobile-remote-setup.md).

Quick version:

```
cd apps/android
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

Produces `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`. Install on a device or
emulator with API 26+.

## Verify (spec §7)

> Lock the phone, trigger a permission prompt, and confirm the escalated
> notification arrives and is answerable well inside the 5-minute deny
> deadline.

Run the desktop daemon (`freecode web --host 100.64.0.x --port 4096`), open
the app on a paired device, send a prompt that needs a tool permission,
lock the phone. The blocked-state notification should escalate to high
importance with the tool name and an explicit "waiting for your approval"
copy (see §5.3 — a hard deadline, not an FYI). Tap it; the WebView comes
to the front with the modal already open.

## Note on §8 Q5

The 5-minute prompt timeout the watchdog derives from is the desktop default.
The spec notes remote use adds notification + phone-unlock latency; the
open question is whether to raise this when a remote subscriber is attached.
v1 uses the desktop default unchanged. The `TurnStateService` watchdog is
parameterised so a follow-up can plumb a longer timeout without changes
elsewhere — see the comment in `TurnStateService.kt`.
