# Harness bench — command reference

> Operator's guide to the **harness signals** and **optimisation task**
> benchmarks that feed `/bench` on the website: what each command does, which
> flag to reach for, and when to run it. Design lives in

> Modelled on [jcode.sh/bench](https://jcode.sh/bench): the same six things
> jcode measures itself on, measured here — resource efficiency, agent
> comparison, an uncontaminatable optimisation task, confidence stepping,
> hill-climbable goals, auto-poke.

| Question | Command | Cost | Doc |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| How much RAM, how fast to first frame? | `pnpm bench:memory` | free | `Benchmark.md` |
| Does it fix real bugs vs Claude Code / OpenCode? | `pnpm bench:agents` | paid | `AGENT-BENCH.md` |
| **How far can it climb an optimisation task?** | **`pnpm bench:jcode`** | paid | **§2** |
| **Does the model step its confidence, rate its goals, finish its lists?** | **`pnpm bench:signals`** | free | **§3** |
| Did my last change make *our* agent worse? | `pnpm eval` | paid | `EVAL.md` |

Everything on this page publishes into `apps/web/app/data/` and appears on
`/bench` by existing. `/benchmark` (the agent comparison) is unchanged and
linked from the hub.

## 1. The three gates (core, off by default)

`apps/core/src/agent/signals/`. The todowrite tool now takes two optional
0–100 scores per item — `confidence` and `hillClimbability` — and the loop can
act on them, plus poke a model that stops with todos open. **All three gates
are off** until `/bench` shows they should not be; the *recording* is always
on, so the bench can compare across the flip.

| Gate | What it does when on | Setting (`~/.freecode/settings.json` or `<project>/.freecode/settings.json`) | Env |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Auto-poke | model stops with open todos → one `<system-reminder>` sends it back; cap 3/run; stops when the list is byte-identical to the last poke's | `"signals": { "autoPoke": { "enabled": true, "maxPerRun": 3 } }` | `FREECODE_AUTO_POKE=1` |
| Confidence gate | an item completed with confidence +40 or more in ONE call → reminder to go verify | `"signals": { "confidenceGate": { "enabled": true, "spike": 40 } }` | `FREECODE_CONFIDENCE_GATE=1` |
| Hill-climb gate | an item rated below 90 → reminder to reframe into something with a check | `"signals": { "hillClimbGate": { "enabled": true, "threshold": 90 } }` | `FREECODE_HILLCLIMB_GATE=1` |

Env beats files in either direction (`=0` switches off). Subagents never poke
or get gated — their parent judges their stop. No gate makes a model call.

Rollout events: `poke.triggered` / `poke.skipped` (`disabled`, `nothing_open`,
`cap_reached`, `no_progress`) on every stop with a list present, and
`todo.signal` (`confidence_spike` / `hill_climb_low`, with `gated`) on every
signal. **Item text never enters the log** — ids only, joinable to the
`function.call` args.

**Flipping a default is an `eval ab` decision** (EVAL.md), not a `/bench`
one: the page shows what happened, the eval shows whether it was better.

## 2. Optimisation task — `pnpm bench:jcode`

jcode bench v1's three tasks (`float-print`, `json-unescape`,
`utf16-transcode`), taken **unmodified** from the public
[1jehuang/jcode-bench](https://github.com/1jehuang/jcode-bench) so the numbers
sit on jcode's axis. The agent gets a working, tested C implementation, an
exhaustive verifier and a deterministic cost model (callgrind instruction
count), and is told to make it faster. Score = `log2(given / yours)`.

```bash
# needs: cc, python3, valgrind   (Arch: sudo pacman -S valgrind)
export MINIMAX_API_KEY=$(node -p "require(process.env.HOME+'/.freecode/config.json').providers.minimax.apiKey")

pnpm bench:jcode --tasks utf16-transcode --agents freecode --trials 1     # smoke
pnpm bench:jcode --agents freecode,claude-code                            # all three tasks
FREECODE_AUTO_POKE=1 pnpm bench:jcode --tasks utf16-transcode             # with a gate on — labelled on the page
```

| Flag | Default | Does what |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--tasks` | every task upstream | comma-separated task ids |
| `--agents` | `freecode` | adapter ids from `bench/jcode-bench/agents/` (same JSON shape as agent-bench; **no `--max-turns`** — the climb is the point) |
| `--trials` | `1` | per (task, agent). jcode's own variance note: run-to-run spread ≈ 0.1, so a single-cell gap under that says nothing |
| `--timeout` | 2h | wall-clock cap on the agent. Time is **recorded, not judged**: a timed-out run's submission is still graded, and marked † |
| `--no-full-gate` | off | skip `--full` on the final grade (float-print's full gate checks all 2³² floats and takes a while) |
| `--final-timeout` | 1h | cap on the full final gate. Past it the harness grades the **sampled** gate instead and flags the row (`finalTimedOut`, ‡ on the page) — a slow verifier is not a wrong submission. float-print's 2³² gate took over an hour here. Finish it later with `pnpm bench:jcode:regrade results/<run>` (no cap, free) |
| `--no-meter` | off | skip the recording proxy (adapter debugging only) |
| `--fresh` | off | empty the task's page file before publishing |
| `JCODE_BENCH_DIR` | `.cache/upstream` (cloned on first run) | a local checkout of the task repo, for offline runs or a pinned commit |

Per trial: the task is staged fresh into a tmpdir, the agent runs **in the
task directory** with one prompt (`runner/prompt.ts`, identical for every
agent), every `./grade` it runs appends to `scores.jsonl`, and when it exits
the harness runs the **official final grade** on the submission as left. Then
the meter is folded (tokens, USD, audit — same proxy and rate card as
agent-bench) and the run is published.

- `best` = the highest sample the agent saw during the climb. Shown, never
  ranked: not every sample runs the full gate.
- `final` = the harness's own grade afterwards. **Ranks.** `null` when the
  final verification failed — a wrong submission has no score, and the run
  exits non-zero.
- The curve on the page is the running best against active time (ms from
  agent start to the last grade), downsampled to the points where it moved.

Artifacts (git-ignored): `bench/jcode-bench/results/<run>/<task>/trial-N/<agent>/`
— `prompt.txt`, `argv.json`, `stdout.log`, `stderr.log`, `scores.jsonl`,
`submission.diff`, `final-grade.log`, `proxy.jsonl`, `usage.json`,
`audit.json`; plus `report.json` at the run root. Published (committed):
`apps/web/app/data/jcode-bench/<task>.json` — every run kept, keyed by
(runId, agent, trial). Re-publish an old run without paying, or finish its full gates:

```bash
pnpm bench:jcode:publish bench/jcode-bench/results/<run> [--fresh]
pnpm bench:jcode:regrade bench/jcode-bench/results/<run> [--task T] [--agent A] [--all]   # full gate, no cap, rewrites report.json + republishes
```

`regrade` rebuilds each trial's workspace from the artifact's `submission/`
(kept whole since the first run; older runs fall back to `submission.diff`)
and runs `./grade --full`. By default it takes trials whose final grade timed
out, failed, or was sampled; `--all` regrades everything.

**No isolation yet.** The agent runs on the host, so the proxy sees only what
is pointed at it (AGENT-BENCH.md §3) and the network is open. Recorded as
such; the container path is agent-bench's to lend (spec §6).

## 3. Harness signals — `pnpm bench:signals`

Free. Folds every recorded session's rollout log
(`~/.freecode/rollout/sessions/*/events.jsonl`) into one file the page reads:

```bash
pnpm bench:signals                 # → apps/web/app/data/harness/signals.json
pnpm bench:signals --since 30      # sessions that started in the last 30 days
pnpm bench:signals --rollout-dir D # another log root (a bench HOME, an eval sandbox)
pnpm bench:signals --json          # print, don't write
```

What it reports, and where each number comes from:

| Section | Number | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Confidence stepping | one line per todo item: confidence at assignment → at completion; which spiked (+40 in one step); which the gate sent back | `function.call` args of `todowrite`, paired per item id; `todo.signal(confidence_spike)` |
| Hill-climbable goals | histogram of every `hillClimbability` rating (re-ratings count again), mean, median, % below 90 | `todowrite` args; `todo.signal(hill_climb_low)` |
| Auto-poke | **sessions that ended with open todos** (from the LAST todowrite — measurable on logs from before the gate existed, which is the baseline), pokes fired, pokes followed by a tool call, items completed after a poke, skip reasons, and the ended-open rate split gate-on vs gate-off | `poke.*` events; `todowrite` args |

Numbers only reach the file: no item text, no session ids, no prompts.

First run on this machine (2026-09-12): 3,364 sessions, 213 with a todo list,
**111 of them (52%) ended with items still open**, zero pokes — every one
predates the gate. That is the number auto-poke exists to move.

## 4. Free, no model — unit tests

```bash
pnpm test:jcode-bench        # typechecks the harness (incl. the agent-bench code it imports), then curve/publish tests
pnpm test:harness-signals    # typechecks, then the fold tests
cd apps/core && pnpm test    # signals/*.test.ts: settings, diff, poke decisions, and a real-loop poke test
```

---

## 5. When to run what

| Trigger | Command | Cost |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Changed a gate, the fold, or the todo tool | the tests above | free |
| Want the page's signal sections current | `pnpm bench:signals` | free |
| Is the optimisation harness still working? | `pnpm bench:jcode --tasks utf16-transcode --agents freecode --trials 1 --no-full-gate` | 1 climb |
| A comparable number | `pnpm bench:jcode --agents freecode,claude-code --trials 3` | 3 × 3 × 2 climbs (hours) |
| Show the effect of a gate on the climb | same, once plain and once with `FREECODE_AUTO_POKE=1` — the page labels the gated run | double |
| Decide a gate's default | `eval ab` per EVAL.md, then edit `DEFAULT_SIGNAL_SETTINGS` | paid |

**Never in CI.** Same reasoning as agent-bench.
